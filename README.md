### Title: "Fair Inference Through Semiparametric-Efficient Estimation Over Constraint-Specific Paths"

### Authors: [Nima S. Hejazi](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/~nhejazi) and [Mark J. van der Laan](https://vanderlaan-lab.org)

### Abstract

We consider nonparametrically estimating a parameter of interest under the
constraint that a functional of the parameter is bounded. We define the
unconstrained parameter as the minimizer of the expectation of a loss function
over the unconstrained parameter space, allowing that the constraint functional
depend on the unknown distribution of the data, thus making it unknown. We
characterize the constrained functional parameter as a penalized expectation of
a loss function and characterize the minimizer over the unconstrained parameter
space as a quantity dependent on the canonical gradients of the expectation of
the loss function and the constraint functional. Further, we show that when
closed-form solutions are attainable, these may be used to define a path through
the unconstrained parameter space that may be used to iterate toward a solution
that satisfies the desired constraint. We present this approach in light of both
prediction problems where we construct optimal ensemble learners via
cross-validation and in the estimation of causal effects under arbitrary
constraints that encode desirable social intuitions -- thereby providing a
mechanism for fair learning and inference.
